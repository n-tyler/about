      <h1>Patrick Henry </h1>
    </center>
    <p>Most of the political leaders of the Revolutionary Age had considerable pretenses to be called men of letters and essays, but not Patrick Henry, who did not care to write much of anything down. </p>
    <div class="b">
      <p>
        <i>“It is all speaking, speaking, speaking…’Tis true he could talk…”</i> (Writ, 1817)
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>A self-learned lawyer, Henry was elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1765. By all accounts, he was its most radical member.</p>
    <div class="b">
      <p>
        <i>“Caesar had his Brutus, Charles the First his Cromwell; and George the Third—[“Treason!” declared the Speaker]—may profit by their example. If this be treason, make the most of it.” (Speech on the Stamp Act, 1765)</i>
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>Henry was a bold patriot—in the sort of rousing style of Samuel Adams—a brazen voice for independence and for republican government based in moral natural law. He represented Virginia in the First Continental Congress 1774, was commissioned as a colonel of the first Virginia regiment in 1775. </p>
    <div class="b">
      <p>
        <i>“…as he proceeded, evinced such unusual force of argument, and such novel and impassioned eloquence as soon electrified the whole house.”</i> (Charles Thomson at the 1774 Continental Congress)
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>Henry was elected Governor of Virginia in 1776–’79, and later in 1784–’86. He and Washington were old acquaintances, and Henry supported Washington in the winter of 1777–’78 at a time of growing discontent with the General, arranged for supplies to Valley Forge encampment. </p>
    <div class="b">
      <p>
        <i>“I have always respected and esteemed him; nay more, I have conceived myself under obligation to him for the friendly manner in which he transmitted to me some insidious anonymous writings in the close of the year 1777 with a view to embark him in the opposition that was forming against me at that time.”</i> (Washington, 1794)
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>In 1787, succeeding Virginia state Governor Edmund Randolph offered to appoint Henry as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention, but Henry declined. When the convention adjourned, Washington immediately sent Henry a copy of the new Constitution. </p>
    <div class="b">
      <p>
        <i>“I have to lament that I cannot bring my Mind to accord with the proposed Constitution…”</i>
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>Henry feared its grant of a strong executive and power vested in a democratic majority without any real checks, and no Bill of Rights. Speaking at the Virginia Ratifying Convention in 1788:</p>
    <div class="b">
      <p>
        <i>“Show me that age and country where the rights and liberties of the people were placed on the sole chance of their rulers being good men, without a consequent loss of liberty?”</i>
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>And separately,</p>
    <div class="b">
      <p>
        <i>“If you have a good President, Senators, and Representatives, there is no danger. But can this be expected from human nature? Without real checks it will not suffice, that some of them are good. A good President, or Senator, or Representative, will have a natural weakness. Virtue will slumber. The wicked will be continually watching: Consequently you will be undone. Where are your checks?"</i>
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>His speeches filled nearly one-quarter of the records, his personality “blazed in all its power and glory.” Randolph supposed that if the convention continued to allow Henry to talk, it may well have lasted six months as opposed to six weeks. Henry found some satisfaction in the proposal of 40 amendments, some later incorporated into the Bill of Rights, yet still argued:</p>
    <div class="b">
      <p>
        <i>“With respect to subsequent amendments…Evils admitted in order to be removed subsequently…Do you enter into a compact first, and afterwards settle the terms of government?”</i>
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>Henry served in the House of Delegates through 1790, then relinquished his seat and to return to practicing law. President Washington offered him a seat on the Supreme Court in 1794 and he refused, tried to appoint him Secretary of State in 1795 and he refused. Upon his death in 1799, the Argus paper of opposing political faction even offered a fine tribute: </p>
    <div class="b">
      <p>
        <i>“[Henry] pointed out those evils in our Constitution…against which we now complain…let the Genius of American Independence drop a tear, and blot it out forever.”</i>
      </p>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <p>
      <i>“Virtue, morality, and religion. This is the armor my friend, and this alone, that renders us invincible…If we lose these, we conquered, fallen indeed…so long as our manners and principles remain sound, there is no danger.”</i> (Letter to A. Blair, 1799) <img class="img-cont" align="right" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Patrick_Henry_Signature.svg">
